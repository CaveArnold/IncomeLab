# [IncomeLab](https://incomelaboratory.com/)
I began using IncomeLab in August 2023. I transferred my plan of record from NewRetirement to IncomeLab. It applies guardrails to monthly withdrawals using all income sources, Capital Market Assumptions, Inflation and Longevity risks.

## IncomeLab Review

Arriving 2026...

## New Features

**January 2025** - TaxLab was released and updated. I now use this to compare Tax Planning alternatives. It generates a histogram with weighted long term Effective Tax rates assuming no changes to the tax law.

**October 2025** - Social Security withdrawal optimizer. This generates a heat map of all optimal withdrawal timing. It also calculates Social Security lifetime withdrawals as an NPV. I use this to manually update our Social Security NPV portion of our total net worth annually in the YTD tables.
